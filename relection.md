Project Overview

This project was built by Tyler Kero and Haoyang Zhang. The entire software was built so that users could find the nearest MBTA station by typing in the location into the box in the browser. First, by completeing the the MBTA_Helper.py, we managed to get the backend of the project working. Everything from calling the API to returning the correct coordinates and using functions to develop a way to call the closest station by converting location to coordinates to function. By calling certain indexes in the dictionaries that the API provided to us, we could finally come out with the final result of the closest station and if it had handicap

Lesson's Learned

1. What went well was everything to do with arrays and dictionaries. After we managed to get the data from the API, parsing out the needed data was relatively simple as it just involved putting the correct indexes. Due to time constraints and confusion, figuring out how to use HTML to make the website better looking and more intuitive would've been something that we'd like to work on. What we kind of struggled with was getting the API to work in the first place. The formatting of the website was extremely complicated and something that we hope can be easier to understand in the future or at least know what to look up. Alot of extra research went into how APIs are properly called in order to parse the correct data. 

2. Working while trying to update the github was relatively difficult as we found that when one person was working on something, it was extremely hard for the other person to help. We found that, at least one time, one person had written the same code that the other person had written for that function so some time was wasted. The team dynamic was relatively good with no major issues, but working out which program was being worked on by who was by far one of the hardest problems.
